  <p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/austinchen27">Austin Chen</a> and I has made a budgeting app because we feel like it has never been done right. We are giving the user more freedom with theyre budgeting like in exel. But also giving them an experince of a well developed app. We want the user to have as much freedom over sorting theyre budgets for the year and be able to acess old data at any time. We plan on expanding on this project, it is very scalable.
